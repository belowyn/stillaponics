«Planted» a few seeds today, in rockwool plugs from IKEA. IKEA have some good beginner sets for basic hydroponics. I started some seeds in a nursery box. Four with red romano salad, four with green romano and five with crispi salad. The next stage only have eight net pots, but better to have a few spare in case some does not grow up.
The lights are set with a timer to be on for 16 hours a day.
