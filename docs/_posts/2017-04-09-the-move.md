Moving the seedlings over to the cultivation tray. Should probably have done this a few days ago, but things have been hectic, so doing it now. The red romano seems a bit weak, and one of the plugs with crispis seems to have long stems without having the roots properly in the rockwool plug. Anyways, time will show how it goes.
